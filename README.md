## Project overview

This project was conducted as my Final Project for the Earth Analytics Bootcamp Spring 2024 course at the University of Colorado, Boulder. In this project, I combine a public tree inventory dataset with ECOSTRESS canopy transpiration data to understand spatial patterns in tree density, species composition and transpiration. Please see the notebook for a full project description. This is a preliminary analysis so results should not be taken as conclusive.


## How to run the code

This code was developed in the Earth Analytics Development Environment which can be installed using the instructions found at this GitHub repository: https://github.com/earthlab/earth-analytics-python-env (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.1311239). In addition to the libraries provided by the development environment, the _geocube_ library is required (https://pypi.org/project/geocube/. The notebook file requires Jupyter Notebook to run. 

There is only one notebook file for this project and cells must be run in order.
